There was, in the northeastern corner of a modestly sized, utterly unremarkable sitting room, a curtain. This curtain, beige in color though not in any particularly notable shade of beige, hung with steady if unassuming dignity from a brass rod secured with four evenly spaced screws. The curtain’s fabric, polyester blend with trace amounts of cotton, offered no discernible texture of interest, though upon close inspection, it exhibited a repeating motif of vertical striations, faint and timid in their commitment to pattern.

At approximately 8:07 a.m. on a Tuesday whose date bore no significance in any calendar of note—neither religious, civic, nor commemorative—a slight breeze entered the room through a slightly ajar window. The breeze was not particularly warm, nor was it especially cool; it was temperate. As it reached the curtain, the fabric swayed minutely, shifting no more than a half inch to the left before returning, in solemn obedience to gravity and the curtain rod, to its original position.

Observing this minute motion was a man named Clive. Clive was not young, nor was he especially old. He existed somewhere in the vast and uneventful middle space of life, where events occur not because of novelty or impending finality, but because things must, at some point, occur. He wore a shirt. It was light blue. The shirt had buttons.

Clive had, over the course of many years, determined that the curtain was satisfactory. It did not thrill him, but neither did it offend. Its presence was a known quantity. On days when the curtain did not move, Clive thought nothing of it. On days when it did, such as this one, Clive would occasionally pause, as he did now, to observe the motion. He did not ask why the curtain moved. He merely acknowledged that it had.

As the curtain settled once again into stillness, Clive considered the weather. He did not have an outdoor thermometer, but he judged the temperature to be neither too cold nor too warm. The light filtering through the curtain was diffuse, unaggressive. It cast no notable shadows. The effect was what Clive would, if pressed, describe as “fine.”

He sat down on a chair with cushions of middling softness and opened a newspaper that had arrived precisely on schedule. The front page headline was about something of importance, though Clive did not feel particularly inclined to engage with it at the moment. Instead, he turned to the section containing the crossword puzzle, which he approached not with excitement but with a sense of preordained routine.

Before filling in any letters, Clive glanced again at the curtain. It remained still.

He did not smile.

Clive regarded the crossword puzzle for several moments before selecting a pencil. He used a mechanical pencil—not due to any strong personal preference, but because it had been near at hand when his previous pencil had exhausted itself approximately sixteen days prior. The mechanical pencil was grey. Its lead was 0.7mm, which Clive considered a practical thickness.

The first clue, 1-Across, read: “A fruit, often yellow, 6 letters.” Clive pondered this. He did not immediately rush to answer, preferring instead to allow the possibilities to settle in his mind like sediment in a calm pond. After a pause of thirty-one seconds, he wrote “banana,” forming the letters with legible, if uninspired, precision.

He did not feel pride, nor any other identifiable emotion.

Outside, the wind paused.

Clive turned his attention to 3-Down, which intersected with the second “A” in “banana.” The clue: “Sound made by a small bell, 4 letters.” He wrote “ding” without hesitation and spent the next forty-five seconds considering whether to pluralize it with an “s.” Ultimately, he decided against it, based on a quiet inner consensus that “ding” alone felt more likely.

He looked up. The curtain had not moved again.

To Clive’s left was a small wooden side table upon which rested a coaster, a mug, and a receipt for a grocery transaction from two days prior. The coaster was round and cork-based. The mug contained tea, which had cooled to room temperature. The receipt detailed the purchase of six items: milk, bread, canned soup, toothpaste, paper towels, and a package of batteries. None of these items were unusual or unexpected. Clive had consumed the soup the evening before. It had been fine.

Returning to the crossword, Clive found himself at 7-Across: “Container for liquids, 3 letters.” He considered the possibilities—jar, jug, can. After a careful process of elimination involving no outward movement but a brief fluttering of the eyelids, he chose “can.”

Once more he glanced at the curtain. Still unmoving.

This pleased him, though not enough to warrant a change in facial expression.

He drank a sip of his tea. The flavor, long faded from heat, was muted. The liquid entered his body and began the digestive journey that all beverages must eventually undertake. This, Clive did not reflect upon.

He set the mug down upon the coaster. The mug aligned perfectly with the cork circle, which gave Clive a small, inert sense of symmetry. He imagined, briefly, that were the curtain to move again, it might do so with slightly more vigor. This was neither hope nor expectation, but mere narrative conjecture—the sort that arises in quiet rooms with no other subjects pressing in.

But the curtain remained still.

Clive continued with the crossword.

Clive completed five more clues in a slow but steady rhythm, pausing between each to briefly scan the surrounding room. To describe the room would be to describe function incarnate: a bookshelf that held books, a clock that kept time, a rug that fulfilled its floor-covering duties without flair. The bookshelf contained seven hardcover volumes, all read once, none twice. The clock ticked. The rug was beige, though in a slightly different beige from the curtain—a warmer hue, if such a distinction mattered.

Clive believed it did not.

At 9:22 a.m., the refrigerator made a low humming sound from the adjacent kitchen. It was a common occurrence, neither alarming nor especially meaningful. The hum lasted twelve seconds. Clive did not react to it, though he was aware of it in the way one might be aware of one's own breathing—distantly, without surprise.

He turned the page of the newspaper, which produced a soft rustling sound. The sound did not echo or resonate. It merely occurred and then ceased. The next page featured an article about local infrastructure, but Clive did not read it. Instead, he stared briefly at the chart accompanying the article, noting that the lines were mostly horizontal, with occasional upward ticks.

He considered the curtain again.

Still motionless.

At this point, Clive briefly contemplated whether the curtain had ever truly moved earlier, or if perhaps he had imagined it. The doubt lingered for a full fifteen seconds before dissipating—not because he resolved it, but because he no longer found it interesting.

He stood.

The act of standing was neither urgent nor difficult. He rose with the practiced efficiency of a man who had stood up many times before. His knees made no noise. He adjusted his shirt, not out of discomfort, but as a matter of protocol.

Crossing the room in precisely six steps, Clive approached the window. He did not open it further. He merely stood near it, gazing out through the screen at a backyard composed almost entirely of lawn. The grass was green—not vividly, not lushly, but adequately so. A bird, possibly a sparrow, flitted from one fencepost to another. Clive watched this with a neutrality that bordered on religious.

Then he looked down.

A small speck of dust rested on the windowsill. He did not touch it.

Instead, he turned and walked back to the chair.

Upon sitting, he noticed the curtain again.

Still unmoving.

He nodded once—not to the curtain, but perhaps in acknowledgment of the day’s reliable tempo.

He returned to the crossword.

The pencil scratched softly on the newsprint.

The clock ticked.

The clue at 12-Down was: “Expression of disapproval, 3 letters.” Clive thought of “tsk,” but hesitated. It was a sound, not a word, though he could not recall whether the crossword's author would allow such liberties. After fifteen seconds of contemplation, he wrote “tsk” anyway, forming each letter with the mild hesitancy of a man aware that correction was always a possibility, however unlikely.

Outside, a car drove past the house at a sensible speed. Clive neither looked up nor adjusted his posture. He knew the car would pass, and that it would not return within the next few minutes. This assumption was not born of any special insight, merely of a quiet confidence in the fundamental forwardness of traffic.

The curtain remained still.

This did not bother him.

By now, Clive had completed seventeen clues. Of the remaining twenty-eight, several were three-letter answers. He favored those, not because they were easier—though often they were—but because their brevity pleased him. A completed three-letter word brought a mild, square satisfaction, like perfectly folding a napkin.

He filled in “era,” “toe,” and “ink” in quick succession. Each word anchored itself in the puzzle grid like a minor triumph, the kind that resists celebration.

The tea had cooled further. Clive took another sip. The taste was unchanged. This was neither surprising nor particularly important.

He considered rising again—perhaps to retrieve the dust cloth from the kitchen drawer and address the speck on the windowsill—but ultimately elected not to. The speck would remain. It was not harming anything. Its presence was not unseemly, merely factual.

He made a mental note to check the batteries in the smoke detector later in the week, although he would likely forget and then remember again at an equally uneventful moment.

The curtain, still motionless, occupied no more or less mental space than the partially completed crossword.

Clive scratched his nose, not because it itched but because it had become a gesture associated with long periods of sitting. He shifted slightly in the chair, redistributing his weight from one side of the cushion to the other. The chair accepted this with characteristic silence.

From the kitchen came the sound of the refrigerator cycling off. Clive marked the sound with the same internal notation he reserved for similar mechanical events—distant, catalogued, irrelevant.

He filled in two more clues.

He paused.

He breathed.

The curtain did not move.

The crossword puzzle was now more than two-thirds complete. Clive paused to admire the grid—not with enthusiasm, nor with pride, but with the kind of modest recognition one might extend to a lawn recently mowed or a sock drawer organized by color and thickness. The pencil, though still adequately sharp, had lost some of its initial crispness. Clive considered retrieving a fresh piece of lead from the small plastic case in the desk drawer but determined the effort unnecessary.

There was, after all, no hurry.

At 10:03 a.m., a fly entered the room. Its approach was heralded by a subtle rise in the ambient sound—a low, inconsistent buzzing that skirted the edges of annoyance but never quite arrived. Clive watched it as it circled the lampshade three times before settling briefly on the wall. He did not swat at it. He did not wave it away. He simply observed it with the same impassivity he afforded all transient visitors.

After thirty-seven seconds, the fly departed, exiting through the same window it had entered, which remained slightly ajar.

The curtain moved faintly.

Clive blinked. The motion was minimal—perhaps three-quarters of an inch, possibly less—but it had occurred. Whether caused by the fly’s passage, a shift in the outside air, or the imperceptible weight of time itself, Clive could not say.

He did not seek to understand the curtain’s motivations. He merely acknowledged them.

The curtain returned, once again, to stillness.

He resumed the crossword.

The clue at 23-Across—“A unit of time, 4 letters”—was “hour.” Clive wrote it in slowly, not from uncertainty but from deliberateness. He liked the symmetry: four letters describing an increment of time, now occupied by an act that itself took a fraction of that very unit.

The page turned again, but not in the newspaper—in Clive’s mind. He realized, with the muted awareness typical of such moments, that the morning was nearing its midpoint. Soon it would be time to make lunch. He had bread. He had cheese. He had, he believed, a cucumber.

He would confirm the cucumber’s presence after finishing the puzzle.

But there was no rush.

The curtain moved again, or perhaps it didn’t. Clive could no longer be certain.

He finished the final clue—“Opposite of off, 2 letters.” The answer was “on.” He wrote it without comment.

The crossword complete, Clive put down the pencil and looked at the curtain one last time.

It was exactly where it had always been.

The End.
